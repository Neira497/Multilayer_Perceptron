# Multilayer_Perceptron

In each folder, they contain Excel databases from which the simple and multiple 
perceptrons will learn, and another to test where the neurons were not referenced with 
that data, all the data is extracted and processed with Pandas, passing them to numpy arrays.

Perceptron or Neural Network classes are created that contain 
the methods to obtain the weights and bias, a method to make predictions, a 
method to do forwardpass and the other method to do the training using backpropagation, while 
the network is trained. neuronal or the simple perceptron, it can be visualized 
by graphing the mean square error from where it starts very high since there is a lot 
of error as they are random weights and biases where they are corrected minimizing the error
